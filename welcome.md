# Welcome

Welcome to the workshop; *"A taster of in situ spatial transcriptomics experimental analysis"*


This workshop aims to provide a practical introduction to using spatial omics analysis to answer research questions; specifically, how to tackle a comparative analysesbetween groups.

We will start with a pre-processed in situ spatial dataset and undertake some basic differential expression, look at differences of proportions of celltypes, and exploratory plotting. We will work in R, using mostly Bioconductor tools. We will use a cosMx dataset, but approaches would be applicable to other technologies like Xenium or vizgen.

Along the way we will discuss considerations specific to spatial analyses, how to scale it up to a full analysis, and how to assess our results. We will also introduce spatial sampler as a resource for examples and codes snippets for analyses on spatial datasets.

This workshop is aimed at newcomers to spatial analyses. Basic R skills are required, a familiarity with single cell analysis is helpful but not essential.
